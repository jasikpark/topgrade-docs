# Supported Platforms

Topgrade should probably work on whichever platform it can be built. The real question is whether
Topgrade knows that platform and can utilize its unique features, such as the operating system's
package manager. Topgrade is tested on and knows the following platforms:

- Linux
  - Arch based
  - Red Hat based
  - Debian based
  - Clear Linux
  - Gentoo
  - NixOS
  - openSUSE
  - Void
- DragonFly BSD
- FreeBSD
- macOS
- Windows
