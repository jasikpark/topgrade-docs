# Topgrade Docs

Documentation for the [topgrade](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade) tool.

This site currently uses the [hugo book](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-book/) theme as a git submodule in `themes/book/`. An example/documentation site for the theme is at <https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-book/>

To build:

- Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and then either:
  - Run `hugo --minify` to build for release
  - Run `hugo serve --minify` to run a local server for development
